# X# Kompendium

## Learning X# with examples

This repo contains the chapters of the X# Kompendium. A book about the very good X# programing language with many examples.

Please feel free to edit them if you find errors, typos or like to add something to it.

There are a few more "bonus chapters" (four actually) which are not part of this repo. They will be part of the final book which will be available as a Pdf. More on this later.

All the examples are part of another repo:
